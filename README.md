<p> subtiles is a web app that allows you to create subdivision tilings.
	It takes in SVG files with a certain format which defines the subdivision.
	You can supply your own files with the open <img src="assets/open.svg"/> button 
	or use one of the presets with the preset <img src="assets/subsquare.svg"/> button.
	The web app then parses the file and uses the information to calculate the subdivided geometry -
	you can use the plus <img src="assets/plus.svg"/> and minus <img src="assets/minus.svg"/> buttons 
	to increase or decrease the displayed subdivision level.
	There are also different mapping functions which can be selected with the mapping <img src="assets/globe.svg"/> button,
	but these have more effect on some tilings than on others.
	Different colour palettes can be selected with the palette <img src="assets/palette.svg"/> button and 
	the theme can be toggled with the dark / light mode 
	<img src="assets/dark-mode.svg"/> / <img src="assets/light-mode.svg"/> button.
	The thickness <img src="assets/thickness.svg"/> button allows you to set the line thickness 
	and the download button <img src="assets/download.svg"/> downloads the subdivision tiling as an SVG. </p>

<h1> SVG input file format </h1>
<p> Input files can be created with an svg editor like inkscape. 
	Each path in the file represents a tile and SVG groups are used to define the relationships between them. <br><br>
	Each tile type that you want to define a subdivision rule for should be in its own group. The only other thing in the group should be a group of tiles to subdivide it into.
	Each iteration, tiles that match the outer tile will be subdivided into those in the inner group. <br><br>
	Matching of tiles to subdivision rules is done by matching the number of vertices of a tile to the number of vertices in the outer tile of the subdivision rule.
	If no subdivision rule matches, the tile is not subdivided. </p>

<pre>
&lt;g&gt; outer subdivision rule group
├── &lt;path&gt; parent tile to be subdivided
└── &lt;g&gt; inner subdivision result group
    ├── &lt;path&gt; top right child tile
    ├── &lt;path&gt; top left child tile
    ├── &lt;path&gt; bottom right child tile
    ├── &lt;path&gt; bottom left child tile
    └── &lt;path&gt; center child tile
</pre>
	
<p> You can take a look at the <a href="presets/square.svg">square</a> and <a href="presets/pentagon.svg">pentagon</a> presets for examples.</p>

<p class="caption"> Custom colouring functions can be defined in the js/palette.js file to get results like this. <br>
	Make sure to add them to the palette menu in index.html! </p>
