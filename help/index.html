	<h1> Thanks for taking a look at subtiles! </h1>
	<p> subtiles is a web app that allows you to create subdivision tilings.
		It takes in SVG files, with a certain format which defines the subdivision.
		You can supply your own files with the file `open` button or use one of the presets with the square `preset` button.
		The web app then parses the file and uses the information to calculate the subdivided geometry -
		you can use the plus and minus buttons to increase or decrease the displayed subdivision level.
		There are also different mapping functions which can be selected with the globe `mapping` button. </p>

	<h2> SVG input file format </h2>
	<p> Input files can be created with an svg editor like inkscape. 
		There should be one group in the file, which contains two items. 
		The first is the path that should be subdivided, and the other is a group of paths which are the result of the subdivision.
		For now, all of these paths should have the same number of vertices, have the same vertex order (eg clockwise) and have no svg `transform` property. </p>
