tile class
subclassed to specific tiles each with overridden
subdivide() method
which returns new tile instances
vertex positions defined in arbitrary space
generalised affine mapping from actual space to arbitrary
space found from actual and arbitrary vertices
then inverse applied to arbitrary subtile vertices to get
actual subtile vertices
tiles stored in linked list, on subdivision big one is
cut out and replaced by a few smaller ones
each tile has a toSVG() methos which retuns an svg elm
that can be rendered

tile space outer verts as static attribute of tile class
map from tile space to world space - affine transform from
tile slice
tile slice defined by centroid and 2 adjacent verts
check point inside slice: dot of direction to point with
directions to verts >= that with other vert
